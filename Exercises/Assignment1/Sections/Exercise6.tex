\section{Dining Philosophers}

Dining philosophers is a known example problem in computer science formulated
by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965 to illustrate a problem that can arise from concurrent
programs. In the assignment there has been provided a program which simulates
the dining philosophers problem. After compilation and a few trial runs we get
a output similar to this which halts:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Output from the dining philosophers program.]
Philosopher 0 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 picked up her left fork.
Philosopher 0 picked up her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is eating.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her left fork.
Philosopher 0 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 picked up her left fork.
Philosopher 0 picked up her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is eating.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her left fork.
Philosopher 0 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 picked up her left fork.
Philosopher 0 picked up her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is eating.
Philosopher 1 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her right fork.
Philosopher 0 is putting down her left fork.
Philosopher 0 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 picked up her left fork.
Philosopher 1 picked up her left fork.
\end{lstlisting}

The program above had two philosophers and two forks. What has happened is that 
philosopher 0 picks up her left fork and philosopher 1 picks up her left fork.
This means that both philosophers are at step 2 and will wait indefinitely for
the other to put down their fork. This means that we have a deadlock, a state in 
which each member waits for the other member, including itsef, to take action.

To solve the dining philosophers problem, we have updated the logic by ensuring 
if a philosopher is unable to pickup their right-fork, they drop current left-fork 
and tries again during the next cycle.

The change that we did is shown in the listing below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Arbitrator/Waiter code modification]
void philosopher(int n, std::mutex *left, std::mutex *right)
    {
      while (true)
      {
        out.lock();
        std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " is thinking." << std::endl;
        out.unlock();
    
        left->lock();
        out.lock();
        std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " picked up her left fork." << std::endl;
        out.unlock();
        if (right->try_lock())
        {
          out.lock();
          std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " picked up her right fork." << std::endl;
          out.unlock();
    
          out.lock();
          std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " is eating." << std::endl;
          out.unlock();
    
          out.lock();
          std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " is putting down her right fork." << std::endl;
          out.unlock();
          right->unlock();
        }
        out.lock();
        std::cout << "Philosopher " << n << " is putting down her left fork." << std::endl;
        out.unlock();
        left->unlock();
      }
    }
\end{lstlisting}
