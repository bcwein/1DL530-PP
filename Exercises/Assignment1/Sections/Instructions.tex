\section{Instructions}

For compiling the code that was provided in the assignment as well as the 
code that was edited for solving the exercises, the makefile provided was used.
In some cases, the programs would not compile with -std=c++11 flag. This was mentioned
in the lectures. If that is the case. Replace the flag with -std=c++0x flag.
