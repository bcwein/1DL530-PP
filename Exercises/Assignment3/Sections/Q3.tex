\section{Q3: Matrix Multiplication}

As in Conway's Game of Life, in this task we have been provided code to parellelise.
In this case, it is a matrix multiplication. Given a $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and
a $n \times p$ matrix $B$. $AB = C$ where $C$ is an $m \times p$ matrix. Each value
of c is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
    c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik}b_{kj}
\end{equation}

Where $i = 1, \dots, m$ and $j = 1, \dots, p$. This will require that our code 
has three loops to calulate all values of $C$. These three nested for loops 
is what we want to parallelise and we have done it as shown in the listing below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(numThreads) default(shared) private(i, j, k)
    {
        #pragma omp for schedule(static)
        for (i = 0; i < dim; i++)
            for (j = 0; j < dim; j++)
                for (k = 0; k < dim; k++)
                    c[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j];
    }
\end{lstlisting}

We tried to collapse the three for loops
