\section{Instructions}

For compiling the code that was provided in the assignment as well as the 
code that was edited for solving the exercises, the makefile provided was used.

We have used \textit{gullviva.it.uu.se} for checking that the code runs.
The code is structured in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Q1
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hosts
        \item Makefile
        \item results.text
        \item sieve\_bcast.cpp
        \item sieve.cpp
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The makefile has several commands. If you want to compile the program:

\begin{center}
    \textit{Make PROG=\textbf{filename}}
\end{center}

Where \textit{\textbf{filename}} is the name of the C/C++ file to compile. If 
you want to run the code locally on one machine. Use the command

\begin{center}
    \textit{Make run-local PROG=\textbf{filename}}
\end{center}

If you want to run it on all three machines in the hostfile, use the command

\begin{center}
    \textit{Make run PROG=\textbf{filename}}
\end{center}
